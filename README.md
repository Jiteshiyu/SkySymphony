## Demo

You can view a live demo of the project [SkySymphony](https://skysymphony.netlify.app/).

## Features

- Fetch weather data for any city
- Display temperature, weather condition, humidity, and wind speed
- Responsive and clean UI design
- Automatically displays weather for London on page load

## Technologies Used

- React (for building the UI)
- Vite (for fast development environment)
- JavaScript/JSX (for logic and structure)
- Axios (for fetching weather data from OpenWeatherMap API)
- CSS (for styling)

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### Prerequisites

Ensure that **Node.js** and **npm** are installed on your machine. If not, you can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Jiteshiyu/SkySymphony.git
   cd SkySymphony
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see the app in action.

## Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: Start the development server.
- `npm run build`: Build the app for production.
- `npm run preview`: Preview the production build locally.

## How It Works

The SkySymphony Weather App uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch and display real-time weather data for any city.

1. **Fetching Weather Data:** The app uses Axios to send a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API, retrieving data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
2. **Search Functionality:** Users can type in the name of a city in the input box and click the "Get Weather" button to retrieve the weather information for that location.
3. **Displaying Data:** The app shows the temperature in Celsius, the weather description (e.g., clear sky), the humidity percentage, and the wind speed in meters per second.
4. **Default Weather:** On page load, the weather for London is automatically fetched and displayed.

## Future Improvements

- Add a 5-day weather forecast.
- Implement geolocation to get weather data for the userâ€™s current location.
- Improve the user interface with additional animations and graphics.
- Add error handling for invalid city names.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **API Integration:** Integrating the OpenWeatherMap API was a key challenge, particularly learning how to handle asynchronous data fetching and updating the UI in real time.
- **State Management:** Using React's `useState` and `useEffect` hooks effectively to manage and update weather data on user input was a great learning experience.
- **Responsiveness:** Designing a clean and responsive user interface helped in understanding CSS layouts and how to make them adaptable to different screen sizes.
